    The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a
    person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article
    Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) +
    (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

    Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate
    (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average
    calories burned for a person. Output each floating-point value with two digits
    after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
    print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')
