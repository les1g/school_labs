# Caffeine Level Calculation Program

## Overview
This program calculates the amount of caffeine remaining in the body after a given number of hours, based on the half-life of caffeine. The half-life of caffeine is assumed to be 6 hours in this program. The program takes the initial caffeine amount in mg as input and then calculates the remaining caffeine after 6, 12, and 24 hours.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## File Structure
- `run_caffeine_levels.py` – The Python script that calculates caffeine levels based on its half-life.
- `README.md` – This file, which provides information on how to run and use the program.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Save the Python script (`run_caffeine_levels.py`) in a folder of your choice.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder where the script is located.
4. Run the script using Python 3 by executing the following command:

```bash
python run_caffeine_levels.py
