    The following is a sample programming lab activity;
    not all classes using a zyBook require students to fully
    complete this activity. No auto-checking is performed.
    Users planning to fully complete this program may consider
    first developing their code in a separate programming environment.

    Pictures made entirely from keyboard characters are known as
    ASCII art. ASCII art can be quite complex, fun to make, and
    enjoyable to view. Take a look at Wikipedia: ASCII art for
    examples. Doing a web search for "ASCII art (some item)" can
    find ASCII art versions of an item; e.g., searching for "ASCII
    art cat" turns up thousands of examples of cats, most much more
    clever than the cat below.

    The following program outputs a simple triangle.
